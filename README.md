# weather-app
Using html, css, and javascript I created a simple weather app that gives the user the current temoerature (fahrenheit), the humidity percentage, and 
wind speed in km/hr. This is done with the OpenWeather Map API. The app takes a city name and gives the user the needed information. 

Will add more to this project
